# React Router Dom v6 Nested Routes Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with nested routes in React Router Dom v6. The problem involves nested routes failing to render correctly, preventing the expected navigation and component display.  The solution involves correctly structuring the routes using the `useParams` hook for dynamic segments.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.

## Problem

The initial `bug.js` file shows how nested routes are improperly configured leading to the nested route not rendering.
